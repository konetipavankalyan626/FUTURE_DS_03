# 📘 Student Feedback Analysis | Sentiment Analysis using Python & TextBlob

This project analyzes student feedback using Sentiment Analysis (NLP) techniques to understand student satisfaction levels and identify improvement areas. It uses Google Colab, pandas, matplotlib, and TextBlob to classify comments into Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiments and visualize the results.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Student feedback provides valuable insights into the quality of teaching, faculty performance, facilities, and overall student experience.
This project processes raw feedback text, cleans the data, performs sentiment analysis, and visualizes the sentiment distribution.

The goal is to help educational institutions make data-driven decisions that improve academic and campus experiences.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess student feedback data

- Apply TextBlob sentiment analysis to classify comments

- Visualize the distribution of sentiments

- Identify areas that require attention or improvement

- Generate insights for academic decision-making

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Tool / Library = Purpose

Google Colab	= Online environment (no setup needed)

pandas	 = Data cleaning & transformation

matplotlib = 	Data visualization

TextBlob = 	Sentiment analysis (NLP)

## 📊 Key Features

### ✔ Sentiment Classification

Analyzes each student comment

Labels it as Positive, Negative, or Neutral

Calculates polarity scores using TextBlob

### ✔ Data Visualizations

Bar chart of sentiment distribution

Count of total positive/negative/neutral reviews

Summary statistics

### ✔ Insights Generated

Percentage of positive feedback

Most common sentiment

Potential improvement areas

Understanding student expectations

## 📈 Results (Summary)

Majority of feedback was positive, indicating a good learning environment

Neutral feedback shows areas that need clarity or communication

Negative comments highlight opportunities for improvement

This analysis helps educators and institutions understand student perspectives more effectively.

## 🧠 How It Works (Simplified Flow)

Import dataset

Clean text (remove special characters, format text)

Use TextBlob to calculate polarity

Classify into sentiment categories

Visualize results using matplotlib

Generate insights
